           Welcome to my portfolio page! The purpose of this site is to showcase some
           of my code projects. I have worked long and hard on developing my skills.
           Believe me, I have spent many long nights learning my craft and I am dedicated to becoming
           a top-notch programmer.
          </p>

            Programming as a career option hadn't been on my radar during my undergraduate days. In fact, I got my Bachelor's
            degree in Neuroscience and Behavior from Columbia University with a vague intention of pursuing a career in the field of biological sciences.
            I did, however, discover a passion for learning and problem solving.
            I find the process of developing code has a suprisingly apt analogy to the creating of a marble sculpture
            - chipping away the smaller parts of a project until there is a recognizably elegant solution. I find programming a wonderfully entertaining pursuit.
          </p>

            If you can't tell by my hopelessly romantic view of computer programming, I am a huge nerd.
            I love Batman and Tyrion Lannister, Neal Stephenson and James Baldwin. I've been known to binge-watch historical documentary
            series, and tweet at Inkmaster contestants. One of my main life goals is to go to ComiCon dressed as Hercule. Suffice it to say, my interests
            run the gambit from the brainlessly trivial to the hopelessly esoteric.
            I take pride in my nerdiness as it is one of my most defining characteristics, but I don't hold it against anyone who doesn't share my enthusiasm.
            I hope these few, broad brushstrokes have given you a little insight into my personality, and that you enjoy browsing the portfolio!
